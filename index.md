I am a student at CSUF, and I'm expected to graduate in 2028. I am a computer science major.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 03
Lab 3 was one of my favorites because it got more difficult than what I was used to because we were starting to use numbers. I enjoyed this lab because while it was difficult, I had a good partner to be able to help me through it. We were able to mutually work together to figure out the coding issues. I liked this because I enjoyed being able to finally work on equations and numbers during the lab because I love working with numbers.

Lab 07
This lab was one of the harder ones for me, as easy as it now seems, it was very hard for me. I kept having linting errors and I was struggling a lot because my partner wasnâ€™t very helpful at the time. Overall, however, the assignment was fun because I was able to code the street names and the rules that the signs had. I think the work was tedious, but it opened my eyes to the small errors that can mess a code up, and it made me more careful with small errors. 

Lab 05
This was one of my favorite labs overall because my partner sat and explained the code to me. I was extremely confused because I had missed a lecture the week before explaining lab 5, which left me a little confused because normally the lectures help clear up any confusion I have. I had went in very confused with what I was doing, and I had a fun time because he was able to show me how to do the code, and why we did what we did.
